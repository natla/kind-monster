## Kind Monster Caf√©

Website design project for an online boutique selling handmade dolls.

This website is a work in progress, its design gets updated from time to time.
Since it's made for designs purposes, it lacks commercial functionality (e.g., the "Add to Cart" button doesn't actually add anything to the cart, which stays empty at all times).

The social share icons have fake functionality, sharing pages of a non-existing website.

The website can be seen here: https://natla.github.io/kind-monster/ 

All the dolls are hand crocheted by me and their photos are also taken by me (crocheting amigurumis is one of my hobbies).

### TO DO:

Change the natural resolution of the images to match their size on screen.
